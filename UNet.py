    # Encoder (Downsampling)
    # Add a series of Conv2D, Activation, and MaxPooling layers
    # can also add BatchNormalization and Dropout layers 
    
    # Bottleneck
    # Add a series of Conv2D and Activation layers
    #can also add BatchNormalization and Dropout layers 
    
    # Decoder (Upsampling)
    # Add a series of Conv2D, Activation, and UpSampling2D or Conv2DTranspose layers
    # can also add BatchNormalization and Dropout layers 
    
    # Output Layer
    # Add a Conv2D layer with softmax activation for segmentation classes
    
    # Compile Model
    # Use an appropriate optimizer and loss function for segmentation tasks
